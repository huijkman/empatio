        What is it like to live with a handicap? What is it like to be hindered when using an app or website? To answer these questions I have started creating short movies about people. These are the first stories. <br />
        The videos are in dutch and have english captions

    <section class="centered">
      <h1 class="decorated"><span class="decorated-content">About Accessibility</span></h1>
      <p>
        These videos were created mainly out of discontent with the way accessibility is being addressed in web-projects. Most of the time it is seen as a technical issue that has to be solved with technical solutions. But that is only part of the story. When I started testing with real people, with real handicaps, it became all too clear that only understanding the technical part just isn't enough. It is also about usability and a thorough understanding of the needs of your users.

      <p>
        Empat.io has only just begun. It needs much more videos and lots of helpful information. Therefore I need help. I need people who want to tell their story so I can show it here. And I want to know what you think. All thoughts and suggestions are welcome.
