        What is it like to live with a handicap? What is it like to be hindered when using an app or website? To answer these questions I have started creating short movies about people. I want to know what it is like and I want to share them with you. Hopefully in this way you will, like me, gain a better understanding and it might help you creating better software that can be used by everyone.

      <p>
        Allthough this site is mainly focussed on designers and developers in the digital domain I'm sure it attracts others as well. I started making movies mainly out of frustration with the way Accessibility is being addressed in projects for the web. Most of the time it is seen as a technical issue that has to be solved with technical sollutions. But that is only part of the story. When I started testing with real people with real handicaps it all became clear that only understanding the technical part just ain't enough. Like every other question in product development the answer lies with the users. By gaining a better understanding of their specific needs you probably will be able to build better products that can be used by every one.

        Empat.io has only just begun. I want to create much more movies and add lots of helpfull information. Therefore I need help. I need people who want to tell their story so I can show it here. And I want to know what you think. All thoughts and suggestions are welcome. Or maybe you like to help in an other way.
